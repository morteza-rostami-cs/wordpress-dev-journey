🔥 Perfect.
This is _exactly_ how a **developer** (not an operator) should learn WordPress — by **understanding the defaults**, then **rebuilding them manually**, then **extending WordPress beyond what plugins offer**, and finally **going headless** with React/Next.js.

Let’s organize and clean up your plan into a structured, professional learning roadmap 👇

---

# 🧭 **WordPress Developer Mastery Roadmap (Fullstack Approach)**

> ⚙️ Goal: Master WordPress as a **developer**, not a user — from default themes & PHP to custom plugins, WooCommerce internals, and headless API integration with Next.js.

---

## 🧱 **Milestone 1 – Explore Default WordPress**

**Goal:** Understand everything that comes _out of the box_ with a standard WordPress installation.

### What You’ll Do:

- Install a clean WordPress site using a default theme (e.g., Twenty Twenty-Five).
- Explore default **pages, posts, comments, menus, widgets**.
- Explore default **blog and comment system** — how it works, what templates render what.
- Understand the **loop**, and how WordPress loads data internally.
- Look into **template hierarchy** (index.php → single.php → page.php → archive.php).
- Inspect **default widgets, menus, sidebars**.
- Create and delete posts, categories, comments — see how data is stored.
- Learn what can be done through **WordPress admin only** (no coding).

✅ **Outcome:** You’ll deeply understand the structure and functionality of a vanilla WordPress blog and how everything connects together.

---

## 🎨 **Milestone 2 – Build a Custom PHP Theme (Covering All WP Data)**

**Goal:** Build your own barebones theme from scratch that fully replaces the default theme.

### What You’ll Do:

- Create a new custom theme folder under `/wp-content/themes/`.
- Register theme support (menus, featured images, etc.).
- Create essential template files (`index.php`, `single.php`, `page.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`).
- Write your own **WordPress loop** to render posts/pages dynamically.
- Display comments, metadata, author info, featured image, etc.
- Replace default widgets/menus with your custom code.
- Implement pagination and sidebar areas.
- Learn how to enqueue scripts/styles properly.

✅ **Outcome:** You’ll have your own **functional custom theme** that displays all WP data (posts, pages, comments, menus, widgets) — 100% developer-built.

---

## ⚛️ **Milestone 3 – Add a React/Gutenberg Component**

**Goal:** Learn how WordPress integrates with React via the **Block Editor (Gutenberg)** and create your first custom block.

### What You’ll Do:

- Set up the **Gutenberg block development environment**.
- Learn the block structure (block.json, index.js, edit/save functions).
- Create a custom React-based block (e.g., a simple “Quote of the Day” or “Dynamic Card” block).
- Add fields and settings to your block using InspectorControls.
- Register it and use it in your post editor.
- Learn how to load dynamic data (e.g., fetch posts via REST API).

✅ **Outcome:** You’ll have a working **custom React Gutenberg block**, understanding how React ties into WordPress’s block editor.

---

## ✅ **Milestone 4 – Build a Full Custom Plugin + Theme Integration (Todo App)**

**Goal:** Learn **custom plugin development**, user authentication, custom post types, and AJAX-based front-end interaction.

### What You’ll Do:

- Build a plugin called `wp-todo-manager`.
- Create **custom post types** (`todo`) and **custom taxonomies** (`category`).
- Add **frontend forms** for registration, login, and adding todos using AJAX.
- Handle authentication and user roles via WP’s user API.
- Create a **custom admin area** (under “Todos” menu) where admin can:

  - View all todos
  - Filter by user, category, or completion status

- Add custom REST API endpoints (for AJAX).
- Build a simple custom theme UI that works with your plugin.

✅ **Outcome:** A full **frontend + backend WordPress app**, powered by your own theme and plugin — real-world level development.

---

## 🛒 **Milestone 5 – Deep Dive into WooCommerce**

**Goal:** Understand WooCommerce architecture and how to fully customize it.

### What You’ll Do:

- Install and configure WooCommerce locally.
- Create a **custom theme** that integrates WooCommerce templates:

  - Product listing, single product, cart, checkout, order confirmation.

- Explore and use **WooCommerce hooks and actions**.
- Fetch and display **custom product data**.
- Add a **custom checkout field** (e.g., date picker + note field).
- Save and display the field data in admin orders.
- Build a simple **custom WooCommerce dashboard** for store owners.

✅ **Outcome:** Deep understanding of how WooCommerce hooks into WordPress — able to build custom product pages, checkout flows, and backend features.

---

## 🧠 **Milestone 6 – Final Project: Headless Multivendor Store (Next.js + WordPress/Woo API)**

**Goal:** Combine everything into a **real-world, headless e-commerce app**.

### What You’ll Build:

A **Multivendor Marketplace** with plan-based membership, using WordPress/WooCommerce as backend & Next.js frontend.

### Features:

- Vendors can register & request store approval.
- Admin approves/rejects vendor requests.
- Vendors can:

  - Manage their own products (CRUD via REST API)
  - See their orders

- Customers can:

  - Browse stores and products
  - Add to cart, checkout

- **Membership system**:

  - Free, Bronze, and Gold plans
  - Plans unlock additional features (custom fields, analytics, limits, etc.)

- Any paid feature not supported by plugins → built manually using **custom plugins/post types**.

✅ **Outcome:** A full **headless multivendor e-commerce platform**, demonstrating mastery of:

- WordPress/Woo backend customization
- Plugin & theme development
- REST API integration
- React/Next.js frontend architecture

This is your **portfolio-ready capstone project**.
