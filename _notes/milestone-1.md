## **Milestone 1: WordPress Fundamentals & Local Setup – Atomic Tasks**

### **Setup Local Environment**

1. Download and install **LocalWP** ([https://localwp.com/](https://localwp.com/)) on your machine.
2. Create a **new local WordPress site** in LocalWP:

   - Choose PHP version (latest stable recommended)
   - Choose MySQL version (default)
   - Set site name and domain

3. Start the local site and ensure it **runs in your browser** (`http://yoursitename.local`).
4. Access **phpMyAdmin** via LocalWP and explore the database.

### **Install & Configure WordPress**

5. Log in to WordPress admin (`/wp-admin`) using default credentials.
6. Change the **admin username/password/email** for practice.
7. Configure **general settings**: site title, tagline, timezone, date format.
8. Configure **writing, reading, discussion, media, permalinks** settings.
9. Install a **default theme** (like Twenty Twenty-Three) and set it active.
10. Install a **few essential plugins** (e.g., Hello Dolly, Akismet).

### **Understand WordPress Folder Structure & Core Concepts**

11. Open the local site folder and explore core folders:

    - `wp-admin`, `wp-includes`, `wp-content`

12. Explore `wp-content` subfolders: `themes`, `plugins`, `uploads`
13. Identify which files correspond to **themes vs plugins**.
14. Learn what **posts vs pages** are, and how **custom post types** fit in later.
15. Explore **users & roles** (Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber).

### **Hands-On Admin Practice**

16. Create **5 posts** with different formats (standard, gallery, quote, etc.).
17. Create **3 pages** (Home, About, Contact).
18. Create **menus** and assign them to the theme locations.
19. Add **widgets** (sidebar, footer, etc.) in available areas.
20. Upload **images & media files**, then add them to posts/pages.

### **Hands-On Mini Project**

21. Build a **small local site**:

    - Home page with title, description, and 1–2 posts listed
    - About page with static content
    - Contact page with contact form (use a plugin)
    - Custom menu linking all pages

22. Test the site fully in your browser.
23. Optional: Export the site (tools > export) to see how WP handles site data.

✅ After completing these **23 atomic tasks**, you will:

- Have a fully working local WordPress setup
- Know the admin panel inside-out
- Understand the folder structure and WordPress concepts
- Have a mini project that is fully functional locally

If you want, I can now do the **same thing for Milestone 2**, making **atomic tasks for PHP & WP Core Development**, ready to follow step by step.

Do you want me to do that next?
